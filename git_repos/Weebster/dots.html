                            Gabimaru the Hollow, a ninja of Iwagakure Village
                            known for being cold and emotionless, was set up by
                            his fellow ninja and is now on death row. Tired of
                            killing and betrayal, he wants to die. However, no
                            method of execution works on him because as much as
                            the seemingly apathetic Gabimaru refuses to admit
                            it, he does have a reason to live. He wants to
                            return to his wife, who was the reason why he
                            softened up and failed to be an effective assassin.
                            Thus, he refuses to die. Asaemon the Decapitator, a
                            famous executioner, sees this and has a proposal for
                            the ninja. He wants Gabimaru to join an expedition
                            to an island south of Japan in search of the elixir
                            of life in exchange for a full pardon by the
                            Shogunate. However, this island isn't a normal
                            island it's believed to be Paradise. However the
                            island is full of mysteries, and the exploring
                            team—consisting of those marked for death—might not
                            be fully prepared to handle them.
